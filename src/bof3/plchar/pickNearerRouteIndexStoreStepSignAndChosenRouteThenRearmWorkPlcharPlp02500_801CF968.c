/* @source 0x801CF968
 * @behavior Overlay step of the front-end work object read through the
 *           scratchpad pointer cell 0x1F800044. It takes the unsigned route
 *           index byte 0x08 and compares its distance from the two candidate
 *           route indices 3 and 5: when the distance to 5 is the smaller one it
 *           asks the shared helper func_801B2D00 for the step sign towards 5
 *           and stores that answer in byte 0x0B, otherwise it asks for the sign
 *           towards 3 and stores that. Both paths then store the chosen
 *           candidate index in byte 0x03, so the two branches share one store
 *           and differ only in the argument and in the constant they hand to
 *           it. The body then sets the countdown byte 0x09 to 2 and increments
 *           the step counter byte 0x02, which re-arms the work object for the
 *           selected route. It takes no arguments, returns nothing and answers
 *           no value. The route byte is loaded once and both distances are
 *           computed from it; the pointer cell is re-read before every store
 *           because a store through the pointer may alias the cell itself; the
 *           first pointer load precedes frame creation and the 0x18-byte frame
 *           only keeps $ra at 0x10 across the calls. The dispatcher at
 *           0x801CF924 scales the work step counter byte 0x02 by four and calls
 *           the pointer run based at 0x801CFFD4, and this body is the word
 *           0x801CFFD4 of that run, so it is entry 0 and is reached from
 *           outside the payload; its prologue and return path alone place the
 *           boundary. The 0xCC-byte range is byte-identical to the span at
 *           0x801CF968 of the plp026 payload, whose row is still asm and so
 *           holds no source to clone, and its nearest exact sibling is the
 *           plp27a lift at 0x801CE448, whose 0xCC body differs only in the one
 *           intra-body jump word that encodes its own shared-store address, so
 *           the statement order, operand forms and declaration style here are
 *           that body.
