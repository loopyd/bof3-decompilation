/* @source 0x801CF89C
 * @behavior Overlay step of the front-end work object read through the
 *           scratchpad pointer cell 0x1F800044. It takes the unsigned route
 *           index byte 0x08 and compares its distance from the two candidate
 *           route indices 3 and 5: when the distance to 5 is the smaller one it
 *           asks the shared helper func_801B2D00 for the step sign towards 5
 *           and stores that answer in byte 0x0B, otherwise it asks for the sign
 *           towards 3 and stores that. Both paths then store the chosen
 *           candidate index in byte 0x03, so the two branches share one store
 *           and differ only in the argument and in the constant they hand to
 *           it. The body then sets the countdown byte 0x09 to 2 and increments
 *           the step counter byte 0x02, which re-arms the work object for the
 *           selected route. It takes no arguments, returns nothing and answers
 *           no value. The route byte is loaded once and both distances are
 *           computed from it; the pointer cell is re-read before every store
 *           because a store through the pointer may alias the cell itself; the
 *           first pointer load precedes frame creation and the 0x18-byte frame
 *           only keeps $ra at 0x10 across the calls. The body is word index 11
 *           of this overlay's sixteen-word handler run 0x801CFCB4 through
 *           0x801CFCF0, so its address 0x801CFCE0 sits three words above the run
 *           base 0x801CFCD4 that the dispatcher lifted at 0x801CEE30 indexes by
 *           work byte 0x02: this step runs as index 3 of that dispatch and is
 *           reached from outside the payload; its prologue and return path alone
 *           place the boundary.
 *
 * Shape note: the 0xCC-byte range is byte-identical to no other span of the
 * extracted payload set, and its nearest exact sibling is the lift at
 * 0x801CE448 of the plp27a payload, which differs in one word only, the
 * intra-body jump at span offset 0x64 that encodes its own shared-store address
 * and shifts by exactly the 0x1454 address delta between the two spans. The
 * same body with the same candidate constants 3 and 5 sits in this payload at
 * 0x801CE448, whose row is still asm, and in 32 further spans of 18 payloads, so
 * the statement order, operand forms and declaration style here are that plp27a
 * body and the literals and offsets are this body own.
 * @status exact
 * @match 100.00
